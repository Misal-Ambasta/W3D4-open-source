# ✅ Solution 2 — Fork & Extend an Open-Source Project using Cursor

## Project Chosen

I chose the repository **code100x/cms** because it's built with Next.js, a framework I'm comfortable working with. The project is active, has clear documentation, and a modular structure, which made it easier to explore and extend.

## Forked Repository

My fork of the project is here: [https://github.com/Misal-Ambasta/cms](https://github.com/Misal-Ambasta/cms)

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Profile Page

**Branch:** `features/user-profile-page`

**Description:**
I implemented a profile page where a logged-in user can view their personal details, including:

- Name
- Email  
- Mobile number

This page fetches user data and displays it in a structured format, providing users with an overview of their account information.

### 2. Forgot Password Page with OTP Verification

**Branch:** `feature/forgot-password`

**Description:**
I implemented a "Forgot Password" workflow:

- Users can enter their email or mobile number
- The system sends an OTP to verify their identity
- Upon successful OTP verification, users can set a new password

This improves the security and usability of the CMS by enabling users to recover their accounts securely.

## How I Used Cursor

I used Cursor's AI features to:

- Explore and understand the project's routing, folder structure, and existing authentication logic
- Quickly identify where to integrate new pages into the app's routing
- Generate and refine code snippets that follow the existing coding conventions and styles of the project
- Resolve minor bugs and improve efficiency while writing components and API calls
