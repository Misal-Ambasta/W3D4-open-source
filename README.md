# üîç Question 1 ‚Äî The Open Source Contributor

## Blog: How to Contribute to Open Source GitHub Repositories

### Goal
To navigate, understand, and contribute to a real-world, unfamiliar codebase using AI tools.

### Tasks

#### 1. Find a Project
Browse GitHub for an open-source project that interests you. It can be in any language you are comfortable with (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Go).

Find a project on your own, it could be on any framework or language you are comfortable with.

#### 2. Analyze and Contribute
- Use Cursor to ingest the entire codebase. Use its features (@ referencing, repo-wide chat) to understand the project's architecture, identify key modules, and find the source of a bug or a good place to add a small enhancement.
- Find an existing issue labeled `good first issue` or `bug`, or identify a small, unaddressed problem yourself.
- Develop a fix or enhancement. Use Cursor to help you write code that matches the project's existing style and conventions.
- Submit as many Pull Request (PR) to the repository.

### Deliverable

A Github repo link with document explaining:
- Which project you chose and why.
- The issue you decided to address.
- Links to your submitted Pull Requests.

# üîç Question 2 ‚Äî Fork & Extend an Open-Source Project using Cursor

## üß† Objective
Learn how to work with existing codebases, use AI-assisted development tools (Cursor), and contribute meaningfully to open-source projects by forking, cloning, and extending real-world software.

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement
Choose an open-source project (on GitHub or similar) written in a framework or programming language of your choice. The project should be active, with a clear README and modular structure.

Your task is to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Set it up locally using Cursor.
3. Use Cursor's AI features to explore and understand the codebase.
4. Implement at least two meaningful feature additions or improvements (suggestions below).
5. Push your changes to your forked repo.
6. Write a short report explaining the features that have been added.

## üìÅ Submission Guidelines

### Required Deliverables
- **GitHub Repo Link** (your forked and modified repo)
- **Report** (PDF or Markdown) covering:
  - Overview of the project
  - Your added features
  - Cursor workflow (what it helped you with)
  - Before/after code snippets and screenshots
