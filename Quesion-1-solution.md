# ✅ Solution 1 — The Open Source Contributor

## Project Chosen

I chose the repository **code100x/cms** because it is built with Next.js, a framework I know well. This made it easier for me to understand the codebase and contribute effectively. The project is active, well-structured, and has good documentation and issue tracking.

## Issue Addressed

I worked on **Issue #1841 - Completed checkbox state only reflects after page refreshing**. The issue was about a bug where marking a task as completed by ticking the checkbox didn't immediately update the UI - the checkbox only appeared checked after a manual page refresh. This caused confusion as users couldn't see their actions were registered.

## My Contribution

I diagnosed the problem related to state management and UI updates in the sidebar component. I fixed the issue by ensuring the checkbox state updates immediately in the UI when toggled, without requiring a page refresh. My changes maintain the project's coding standards and style.

I submitted a Pull Request for this fix: **PR #1857 - fixed: #1841-sidebar-checbox-bug**
